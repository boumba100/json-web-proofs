Abstract

   JSON Proof Token (JPT) is a compact, URL-safe, privacy enabled means
   of representing claims to be transferred between three parties.  The
   claims in a JPT are encoded as JSON objects that are used as the
   payloads of a JSON Web Proof (JWP) structure, enabling the claims to
   be digitally signed and selectively disclosed.  JPTs also support
   reusability and unlinkability when using Zero-Knowledge Proofs
   (ZKPs).

1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Proof (JWP) draft establishes a new secure container
   format that supports selective disclosure and unlinkability using
   Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) or other newer cryptographic token.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   JWP defines a clean abstraction around the parts of a container
   binding together a protected header and one or more payloads.  It
   does not define any details about the interactions between an
   application and the cryptographic libraries that implement proof-
   supporting token.

   Due to the nature of ZKPs, this specification also documents the
   subtle but important differences in proof token versus those defined
   by the JSON Web Token RFC.  These changes help support more advanced
   capabilities such as blinded signatures and predicate proofs.

4.  Security Considerations

   *  Protected Header Minimization


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
